# OverTheWire Bandit - Level 5 Solution

# I started by using 'du' to explore the 'inhere' directory
bandit5@bandit:~$ du -a -b
# Mistake: I should have focused on files of size 1033 bytes as hinted in the game instructions.
# Instead, I was looking at every file.

# Output of 'du -a -b' (partial output to show exploration process)
6351    ./inhere/maybehere02/.file1
3801    ./inhere/maybehere02/-file1
6746    ./inhere/maybehere02/spaces file1
4932    ./inhere/maybehere02/-file3
...
807244  .

# Then I used 'du -h' for human-readable file sizes.
bandit5@bandit:~$ du -h
64K     ./inhere/maybehere02
72K     ./inhere/maybehere19
52K     ./inhere/maybehere08
...
1.3M    .

# While exploring, I noticed several files with "spaces" in their names. I made a mistake by focusing on file names rather than sizes.
# So, I reran 'du -a -h' to get more readable output and target files with unusual sizes.
bandit5@bandit:~$ du -a -h
8.0K    ./inhere/maybehere02/.file1
4.0K    ./inhere/maybehere02/-file1
8.0K    ./inhere/maybehere02/spaces file1
8.0K    ./inhere/maybehere02/-file3
4.0K    ./inhere/maybehere02/-file2
...
# Too much irrelevant information, I was getting lost.

# I realized I needed to focus on the specific file size mentioned in the game hint: 1033 bytes.
# So I switched tactics and used 'find' to narrow down my search.
bandit5@bandit:~$ find . -type f -size 1033c
./inhere/maybehere07/.file2

# Success! I found the file with the correct size: './inhere/maybehere07/.file2'

# Now, I simply read the file to retrieve the password for the next level.
bandit5@bandit:~$ cat ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
<password-for-level-6>

# Conclusion:
# The learning process involved filtering out irrelevant files and focusing on the correct file size (1033 bytes).
# The key takeaway: Be attentive to game hints and use efficient search commands like 'find' to save time.
