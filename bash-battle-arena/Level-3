Task:

Write a script that checks if a file named hero.txt exists in the Arena directory. If it does, print Hero found!; otherwise, print Hero missing!.

Solution:

#!/bin/bash

HERO="./Arena/hero.txt"

if [ -f "$HERO" ]; then  # Fixed the syntax by using a single-bracket test
        echo "Hero found!"
else
        echo "Hero missing!"

fi
