Level 1: The Basics

Mission: Create a directory named Arena and then inside it, create three files: warrior.txt, mage.txt, and archer.txt. List the contents of the Arena directory.

# Create a directory named "Arena"
mkdir Arena

# Check the contents of the current directory to confirm "Arena" was created
ls

# Move into the "Arena" directory
cd Arena

# Create the "warrior.txt" file using Vim (or any editor of your choice)
vim warrior.txt

# Verify that "warrior.txt" was created
ls

# Attempted to create "mage.txt" and "archer.txt" with a pipe but corrected the approach
# Create both "mage.txt" and "archer.txt" using the `touch` command
touch mage.txt archer.txt

# Verify that all three text files exist in the "Arena" directory
ls
