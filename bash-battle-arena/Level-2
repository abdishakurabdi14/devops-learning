# Open a new script file named "number-script.sh" in Vim
vim number-script.sh

# Add the following bash script to count from 1 to 10
# (Initial content was missing the "done" statement at the end)

-
#!/bin/bash

count=1

while [ $count -le 10 ]
do
        echo "$count"
        ((count++))
done
-

# Make the script executable
chmod +x number-script.sh

# Run the script
./number-script.sh

# Initial run resulted in an error: "syntax error: unexpected end of file"
# This was because the "done" statement was missing to close the `while` loop.

# Open the script again in Vim to fix the issue
vim number-script.sh

# Run the corrected script
./number-script.sh

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
